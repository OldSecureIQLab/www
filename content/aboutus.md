SecureIQLab is a US-based independent, third-party cybersecurity solution validation and advisory service provider. 
SecureIQLab specializes in assessing and validating a multitude of cyber threat-facing cybersecurity solutions that aim to defend enterprise IT systems and applications from attacks through prevention, detection and effective response.

The enterprise use-case validation criteria and models were developed over years of experience working with several Analyst and testing firms, Fortune-500 enterprises and multiple security technology/solution vendors. These enterprise specific use-case metrics helps bridge the “Cyber-Gap” exposure for them by reducing their operational risk through effective validation of their security controls.

The foundation of our validation programs is the development of a dynamic process for updating enterprise validation criteria and raising the bar to drive evolutionary and progressive reduction of risk over time.

Further more, this custom validation enables vendors and enterprises alike to verify a specific feature or function or commission a comprehensive evaluation. Custom validation also leverages our extensive knowledge of security-related products and years of experience to deliver expert third-party validation and evaluation services designed to meet the specific needs of security vendor’s engineering, sales, marketing and research teams. Enterprises benefit from SecureIQLab custom validation through access to the same credible, real-world evaluation methods that have made us one of the global leaders in the information security space.

SecureIQLab clients also receive the assurance they need to go-to-market with a product (or) deploy/implement a solution without worrying about problems that otherwise may stall rollouts and tarnish their reputations.
